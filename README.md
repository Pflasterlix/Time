## Project Description: Interactive Timepiece with Sliders

This project introduces an interactive timepiece that displays the current time using sliders. The webpage showcases a sleek clock that represents hours, minutes, and seconds through separate sliders. Each slider moves smoothly to visually depict the current time.

The aesthetics of this project lie in its simplicity. The focus is on presenting time in an innovative and user-friendly manner. The sliders provide an intuitive method to read the time, allowing users to grasp the time at a glance.

From a technical standpoint, the project utilizes HTML, CSS, and the GSAP library to create the animated sliders. The use of Google Fonts imparts a clear and modern typography style to the clock, contributing to the overall appeal of the project.

Through the straightforward yet effective design of the timepiece, a user-friendly experience is crafted. The sliders convey time in a precise yet engaging manner, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases.
